# Research Focus

My long-term goal is to understand how we use visual information to navigate complex social environments. My lab integrates neural signals across spatial scales—from microscopic (single neuron) to macroscopic (fMRI).

### 1. A Computational Framework for Object Recognition
*How does the brain transition from seeing "features" to recognizing "people"?*

We have identified a hierarchical transition in the human temporal lobe. While the Ventral Temporal Cortex (VTC) employs an **axis-based code** (analyzing features like texture or shape), the Medial Temporal Lobe (MTL) utilizes a **region-based code** to form invariant representations.

[cite_start]*Fig 1. The transition from feature-based coding in the VTC to invariant region-based coding in the MTL[cite: 34, 37].*

**Key Findings:**
* [cite_start]Discovered a novel region-based coding model in human amygdala/hippocampus neurons[cite: 34].
* [cite_start]Demonstrated that MTL neurons encode a feature space constructed from the preferred axes of upstream VTC areas[cite: 37].

### 2. Social Cognition & Neural Dynamics
*How do we form first impressions and infer intentions?*

Beyond identity, faces convey rich social information. I investigate how these computations adapt across different contexts, such as emotion recognition and trait judgment.

[cite_start]*Fig 2. Mapping the neuronal social trait space and its alteration in clinical populations[cite: 70].*

**Key Findings:**
* [cite_start]Identified a 4-dimensional social trait space in the amygdala/hippocampus[cite: 70].
* [cite_start]Revealed domain-specific mechanisms for social inference (Theory of Mind)[cite: 49].

### 3. Clinical Applications: Autism & Schizophrenia
*Bridging the gap between neural circuits and social deficits.*

I am currently extending my computational framework to understand atypical face processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. By comparing intracranial recordings and fMRI data, we aim to pinpoint the specific circuit disruptions that lead to altered social trait judgments.
