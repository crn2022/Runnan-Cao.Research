### About Me

I am a computational and social neuroscientist investigating how the human brain transforms complex visual information into unified semantic meanings. 

My work bridges the gap between **visual perception** and **social cognition**. Using a multimodal approach—combining **human single-neuron recordings**, intracranial EEG (iEEG), fMRI (3T and 7T), and **computational modeling** (Deep Learning)—I aim to delineate the circuit dynamics underlying face and object recognition.

Currently, I am an Instructor at Washington University in St. Louis. My research is supported by the **BRAIN Initiative K99/R00 Award** and the **BBRF Young Investigator Award**.
